System Architecture
The system is designed as a pipeline that takes a high-level prompt for a Linux device driver, generates C code using multiple AI models, and then subjects the generated code to a series of evaluations. The architecture can be broken down into the following key components:

Prompt Input and Weighting: 
    The process begins with a user-defined prompt that describes the desired device driver.
    This prompt is first analyzed to determine its complexity, which is used to assign a weight to the evaluation results. 

Code Generation: 
    The prompt is then passed to a code generation module that utilizes multiple Gemini models to generate C code for the device driver. 
    This allows for a comparative analysis of different models' outputs for the same task. 
    The system is designed to handle potential failures in code generation from any of the models. 

Evaluation Suite: 
    Once the code is generated, it is passed through a comprehensive suite of evaluators. Each evaluator focuses on a specific aspect of code quality and correctness:

    Compilation: The code is compiled as a Linux kernel module to check for syntax errors and other compilation issues.

    Code Quality: A hybrid analyzer assesses the code's style, documentation, and maintainability. It uses clang-tidy for static analysis and custom regex for documentation metrics.

    Security: A vulnerability scanner checks the code for common security pitfalls in kernel development, such as improper memory management and API misuse.

    Functionality: A static analyzer evaluates the implementation of essential driver functionalities, error handling, and edge cases.

Results Aggregation: 
    results from all evaluators are collected and aggregated.
    The final output provides a detailed report for each AI model's generated code, including compilation results, security scores, quality metrics, and functionality analysis.
